Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer. We are working on the 'main' branch of this repository, and the goal is to produce production-ready code for our initial push.

Project Goal: Build a Modern Productivity Dashboard as a single-page application.

Technical Stack:
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3.
- Use a mobile-first, responsive design with "Glassmorphism" aesthetics (dark mode).

Core Features:
1. Dynamic Header: A large digital clock with a greeting that updates based on the system time.
2. Task Management: A To-Do list with Add/Delete functionality using localStorage for persistence.
3. Focus Timer: A 25-minute Pomodoro countdown timer.

Requirements:
- Ensure the project structure is clean: index.html, css/style.css, and js/app.js.
- Write modular, well-commented code.
- Once the code is written, summarize the changes so I can review them before we commit to the main branch.

Please initialize the file structure and write the implementation now.
